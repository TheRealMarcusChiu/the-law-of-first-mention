        <p class="sub">The Law of First Mention, also known as the Law of First Occurrence, is a principle used in biblical interpretation that suggests the first time a word, concept, or doctrine appears in scripture, it sets a pattern for its meaning throughout the rest of the text. Understanding this initial usage can provide key insights into the word's theological or symbolic significance. However, it's important to consider that later uses may provide further clarification or nuances</p>
